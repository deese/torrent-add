# Torrent-add

Add torrents to RuTorrent

The software is provided as-is and works for me :)


Set the configuration values running the following command. This will not work if it's compiled (as it doesn't have a console)
 python torrent_add.py --config "something"

Set the rutorrent path if it is not configured on /rutorrent/ running the following
  python torrent_add.py --set-rutorrent-path  "something"

Yes, you need to type the something because of the opt parser. I will fixit or not :D
